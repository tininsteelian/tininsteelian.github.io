		<h4><ul>
			<li><a href="http://tin.zone/stuff/theblankofblank/">The Blank of Blank</a> - This is the McDonald's of dumb websites.</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/buttsbot">Buttsbot</a> - A Twitch bot that randomly repeats what chat users say while replacing random syllables with "butt". It's in over 1,000 Twitch channels! Credit goes to pinguino for originally creating the bot, I simply wrote the current version of it.
			<li><a href="https://github.com/tininsteelian/ClipArtBot-Real-Time-Repainter">ClipArtBot</a> - A Twitch bot that displays a random image of a given keyword entered by a chat member. It can also automatically replace textures in GameCube and Wii games with the Dolphin emulator. It's even a MIDI jukebox! A very old version is available for download, maybe eventually I'll set up the current version so that other people can use it.
			<li><a href="http://tin.zone/stuff/clipartorstockphoto/">Clip Art or Stock Photo?</a> - A paper I wrote in college about using neural networks to determine whether a given image is clip art or a stock photo.</li>
			<li><a href="http://tin.zone/downloads/RCTChallenges.exe">RollerCoaster Tycoon Challenges</a> - A program that randomly selects challenges to make your RollerCoaster Tycoon experience that much more challenging.</li>
			<li>TinBot - A Discord bot that hosts trivia matches. It can also suggest what food to eat, provide motivational quotes, and acquire information using WolframAlpha. There isn't currently a download link for it, sorry.
